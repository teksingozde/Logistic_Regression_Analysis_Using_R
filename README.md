# Logistic Regression Analysis

## Overview of Logistic Regression

One of the most used methods as an alternative to discriminant analysis and crosstabs logistic regression, normal distribution and common covariance assumptions were not met used at times. Logistic regression does not meet these assumptions. The reason is from the data set to be analyzed. That is, the dependent variable sorter and classifier scale, but independent variables can also be found on continuous or categorical scales they may be. A variable on a limiting or categorical scale is added to the logistic regression model. When it is desired to be added, some transformations should be made on the variables. This transformations will give a linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable. Thus, the link can be one of the function, logit or probit transformations. For example, independent the result obtained as a result of these transformations of the 1 unit increase in the variables and the we can say that it causes a change in the independent variable as much as the product of the coefficient.

It should also be noted that; Since there are transformations on the variables in the model the maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the coefficients of the variables. In order for the obtained model to make sense, the independent variables in the model the significance of the coefficients needs to be tested. Tests, your best model they are guiding in making the establishment with the least variable. Logistic regression model,
Since it is not like the classical regression model, the likelihood ratio test is used to test the coefficients  (likelihood ratio test), Score test and Wald tests are used. The main problem here is; your model the variable to be examined about the dependent variable, whether it contains more information.

Odds (from differences) and odds ratio when interpreting the coefficients in the logistic regression model (the ratio of differences) is used. Odds taken from the natural logarithms of the logit transform is still. Odds ratio is the ratio of odds calculated for x=1 to odds calculated for x=0. The natural logarithm of the difference ratio gives the log odds ratio. will be included in the model
The variables are decided by interpreting the likelihood ratios and Wald statistics. One of the criticisms brought to logistic regression is that as the number of variables increases, it becomes difficult to build a model it is difficult. In other words, as the number of variables increases, the operation to be performed increases. Such transactions doing it is not as easy as it seems. In addition, an increase in the number of variables is predicted. It also causes the standard errors to be high. This is the main dataset increases its dependency.

Since the parameters of the logistic regression model cannot be obtained analytically, an alternative as a method, estimation with the maximum likelihood (Maximum Likelihood=ML) technique is being done.
The assumptions about the type and distribution of the variables are few and the results are easily interpretable, etc. For reasons, logistic regression method is a frequently used method in recent years became the regression method. The number of categories of the qualitative dependent variable and different logistics according to whether the categories are unordered (nominal) or ordered (ordinal) regression methods are used.
